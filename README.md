# Spotify Karaoke (Draft)
##


## Concept
The goal of this project is to develop a mobile and web application that allows users to link their Spotify accounts, search for a desired song, and sing along to the lyrics as they appear on the screen.

### Register / Sign In
- Authentication will be set up using firebase. 
- Users will be able to sign in or register for the app using their email and a created password
- Once signed in to the app, users will be able to sign in to their spotify and connect it to the application 

### Song Selection
- Once users log in, they will search for songs and once they find a desired song, they will be connected to a graphic lyric display screen 
- The user will be able to play, pause, and skip to anywhere in the song being played 
- When the user ends the song, they will be taken back to the song selection screen where they can choose another song or log out of the application
